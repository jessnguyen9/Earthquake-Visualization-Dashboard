# leaflet-challenge

This project is a data visualization tool that allows users to visualize earthquake data collected by the United States Geological Survey (USGS). 

The goal of this tool is to display the earthquake data and educate the public and government organizations about the issues facing our planet.

**CREATE THE EARTHQUAKE VISUALIZATION**

**Dataset**

Visit the USGS GeoJSON Feed page.

Choose a dataset to visualize, such as "All Earthquakes from the Past 7 Days."

Click on the dataset link to view the JSON representation of the earthquake data.

**Data Visualization** : The visualization is created using Leaflet, a JavaScript library for interactive maps.

  1. By using Leaflet, create a map and plot all the earthquakes from the chosen dataset based on their longitude and latitude.

  2. Represent the magnitude of each earthquake using marker size and the depth of the earthquake using marker color.

  3. Include popups that provide additional information for each earthquake.

  4. Create a legend that provides context for the map data.
